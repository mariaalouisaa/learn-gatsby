            <li>Once the developer has created the source code, Gatsby takes care of the rest by compiling the most efficient Webpack configuration to build the website.</li>
            <li>It sticks to Google’s PRPL (Push, Render, Pre-cache, Lazy-load) architectural pattern, which boosts a website's performance on mobile devices.</li>
            <li>Gatsby.JS allows no scope of direct connection to the database, user data, dependencies, and other sensitive information. This ensures that your website is more secure than the other regular websites of your competition.
            </li>
            <li>Gatsby allows you to grow your margin by cutting the costs of hosting and updates.</li>
            <li>Due to the presence of themes, plugins, and starters in its ecosystem, developing a fully working Gatsby JS application is a matter of minutes.</li>
